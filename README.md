# Sustainable-Peace-Project
Our key objective in this project was to try and use Topic Modeling on Anthropological data to see if a clear distinction between peaceful and non-peaceful societies could be obtained. On getting unsatisfactory results with Topic Modeling algorithms, we decided to move to vector based approaches that could give us better insights into our data. Using the results gained from the vector based approaches, we started building a custom peace lexicon that can be used in conjunction with sentiment analysis and classification models to generate a peace index that can be used to determine how peaceful a society is and also track changes in scores over time.
